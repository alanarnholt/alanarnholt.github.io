In 1986, I graduated from the [United States Military Academy at West Point](http://www.usma.edu) with a B.S. in the Mathematics of Operations Research.  When I graduated, I was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army.  My first duty station was [Fort Carson, Colorado](http://www.carson.army.mil). While at Fort Carson, I received an M.S. in Statistics from the [University of Northern Colorado](http://www.unco.edu) in 1989.  In 1990, I resigned my commission from active duty and began work on a Ph.D. at the University of Northern Colorado.  I received the Ph.D. in Statistics August 1993.  Since July 1993, I have served in the Department of [Mathematical Sciences](http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu) at [Appalachian State University](http://appstate.edu). I am married to Susie Arnholt, who is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of [Mathematical Sciences.](http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu) We are extremely blessed and have two wonderful daughters.
